# Servo-Motor-Control-Algorithm-for-Robot-Walking
This README provides a detailed algorithm for controlling servo motors to simulate walking in a robot. It includes initialization steps, a main loop for continuous walking, and specific functions for lifting, moving, and placing both legs. The goal is to achieve a smooth walking motion by sequentially adjusting servo angles.
